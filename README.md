**Q1.**
The institute has been recently set up to provide state-of-the-art research facilities in the
field of Software Engineering. Apart from research scholars (students) and professors, it also
includes quite a large number of employees who work on different projects undertaken by
the institution.
As the size and capacity of the institute is increasing with the time, it has been proposed to
develop a Library Information System (LIS) for the benefit of students and employees of the
institute. LIS will enable the members to borrow a book (or return it) with ease while sitting
at his desk/chamber. The system also enables a member to extend the date of his borrowing
if no other booking for that particular book has been made. For the library staff, this system
aids them to easily handle day-to-day book transactions. The librarian, who has
administrative privileges and complete control over the system, can enter a new record into
the system when a new book has been purchased, or remove a record in case any book is
taken off the shelf. Any non-member is free to use this system to browse/search books
online. However, issuing or returning books is restricted to valid users (members) of LIS only.
The final deliverable would be a web application (using the recent HTML 5), which should
run only within the institute LAN. Although this reduces security risk of the software to a
large extent, care should be taken no confidential information (eg., passwords) is stored in
plain text.

    Functional Requirements:
    1. User came to see all available books without login/signup.
    2. If the user wants to borrow that book user can log in or become a member by signup 
    3. Users can search and filter books by their name, author name, ISBN, etc.
    4. User will get all detail about the book and the deadline to return that book
    5. Users will be notified about their return of the book in advance.
    6. If any other member does not borrow the book, the user can extend their deadline by requesting the librarian.
    7. User who is a member can request to add the book to the librarian.
    8. User can see all his history of book transactions with LIS.
    9. Librarian(Admin) can make changes in the database by deleting, adding, and updating the data.
    10. User's password or any other credential will not be shown on the application in any form.
    

    NonFunctional Requirements:
    1. Database of this application is extensive, so we need a server with a large capacity.
    2. Also, we need to back up the data so we can start with backed-up data whenever the system crashes.
    3. Website should be userfriendly
    4. Transaction of books should be fast; we can archive by using Local Arean Network(LAN)
    5. To handle many requests, we need to use a higher-end computer.
    
    
 **Q.2.**
 Identify scope, features and non-functional aspects of the following problem.
Approximately 5% of the world population (or a staggering 466 million people) suffers from
disabling hearing loss. We set out to create an impactful solution for this community that
addresses some of their everyday needs. Our mobile application uses artificial intelligence to
recognize key sound events of interest to this community, such as car horns and babies,
where immediate alerts and continual logging are critical for the user. This app is optimized
for Android with low-latency so that it works in real-time for use.

    Scope:
    We can target the audience of those suffering from hearing loss which is very large number. 
    They will be able to identify critical sound occurrences using this program that calls for an immediate alarm or ongoing logging using artificial intelligence.
    We use
